Earlier this year I ran an hour long workshop on writing a CV, for the Year 10 students at Winchcombe School.  Here are a few notes on how the day went and some lessons for next time.

I structured this as a short intro to CVs with some slides, followed by an exercise where the students had a go at writing their own CV.

In case they are of use to anyone, here are the slides I used for the session:

## What Went Well
On the whole the workshop was well received.  The students showed a lot of interest and rated the session highly in the feedback survey.  This was my first time running a class based session like this, and I’m grateful to the Winchcombe students for being so engaged and welcoming!

I also had some good discussions with the students while they were working on the exercise.  I really enjoyed hearing about their aspirations, and some of the impressive things they’ve already accomplished.

## What I’d Improve
Giving the students the task of writing their own CV was too open ended, and perhaps a little overwhelming for those unsure how to get started. 

If I were to run the session again, I’d break this down into a number of shorter exercises, focussing on how to write about your experience and evidence your skills on a CV. 

For example:
* talk about a time where you’ve been in a position of responsibility, or a time when you’ve shown initiative.
* describe a challenge you faced, how you overcame it (or didn't) and what you learnt.

This would provide some useful rails to those who found the idea of starting from a blank page a daunting task, and help keep everyone on track throughout the session.
